# High-School-Project 1: Rocktest.

This is a software that is used to create multiple-choice exercises and tests for Vietnamese teachers, especially those my high school. At the time, they were using McMix, a software that, in my opinion, has a terrible UI/UX. I wanted to change it but failed due to personal limitations.
